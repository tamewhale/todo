Todo
====

Todo is a simple web-based to-do list built on CodeIgniter.

It is still unfinished and has some files that have been pulled in from a previous, simpler incarnation but not yet converted for use with CI. As such it should not be used yet as a real app without some modifications.

I started it as a learning exercise in CI so it's not intended to be of use to anyone but feel free to have a look at the code and criticise.

Todo is built on top of CodeIgniter version 2.0.2. Most of the CI files have been removed from the repo for simplicity. The database config has been removed for security but I may add some SQL for the database structure later.
