Todo
====

This is a simple web-based todo list built on CodeIgniter. I started this 
as a learning exercise in CI so it will probably be of no use to anyone, 
ever. Feel free to have a look at the code and criticise.

Todo is built on top of CodeIgniter version 2.0.2. Most of the CI files 
have been removed from the repo for simplicity. The database config has 
been removed for security but I may add some details of the database structure
at a later date.
